# AMF-6G Simulation Dataset

This repository contains the datasets generated from Mininet-based simulations used in the paper:

"Adaptive Multi-layer SDN Framework for 6G Network (AMF-6G)"

## Description of the Dataset
The dataset was generated by running each simulation scenario ten times using different randomized network topologies and initial conditions. The results reported in the paper correspond to the average values across these runs.

Each JSON file corresponds to one simulation repetition for a given scenario.

## File Structure
/ScenX_repY.json : Raw simulation output for scenario X, repetition Y  
/all_aggregated.json : Aggregated results (mean, std, min, max)

## Methodology
Simulations were performed using Mininet. Randomization was applied to network topology and initial conditions to ensure statistical robustness.

## License
This dataset is provided for research and academic use.
